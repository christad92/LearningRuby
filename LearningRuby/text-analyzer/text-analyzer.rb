This project helps to build a teext analyzer which will read in text supplied in a separate file, analyze it for various patterns and statistics, and print out the results for the
user. Itâ€™s not a 3D graphical adventure or a fancy web site, but text processing programs are the bread and butter of systems administration and most application development
